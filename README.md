Cerberus 2080 and 2100 firmware

### What is the Cerberus

The Cerberus is an innovative 8-bit multi-processor microcomputer board designed by Bernardo Kastrup aka The Byte Attic. It can run either Z80 or 6502 code off native on-board CPUs, and the board BIOS runs off an ATmega328p. The board is open-source, and you can find more details about it here.
