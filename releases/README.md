# releases

These releases are compiled on an ad-hoc basis and have been tested on a Cerberus board before release.

Note that this version currently requires the custom CAT code to be installed on the ATmega328p before it will run correctly. This can be found in the [cat](cat) folder, along with instructions on building and installing it.

You will need to rename the file to an 8.3 filename with no special characters to make it easier to load from the Cerberus BIOS screen, i.e. `bbcbasic.bin`

##### 20210810: Version 0.01
- Key scanning and output routines
- Screen output routines
- Plot and Draw graphics primitives added
- Extended GET and GET$ to read characters off screen
